 Developed an LSTM-based sentiment analysis NLP model that enhances text messages by automatically adding
 relevant emojis, utilizing pre-trained GloVe embeddings for word representation.
 Implemented padding to manage variable-length input sequences, applied dropout for regularization, and utilized the
 Adam optimizer for optimization.
 Achieved a training set accuracy of 98% and a test set accuracy of 92%.
